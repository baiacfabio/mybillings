MyBillingsMethod is the new and most innovative women's health app, empowering the user to take control of her fertility without harmful chemicals. This app uses the Billings Ovulation Method to monitor fertility by identifying when they are fertile and when they are infertile during each ovarian/menstrual cycle. Users pay attention to the sensation at their vulva, and the appearance of any vaginal discharge. The Billings Ovulation Method does not rely on the presence of ovulation, rather it identifies patterns of potential fertility and obvious infertility within the cycle, whatever its length.
